# Quadratic Equations Solver

[TODO. There will be project description]


# Example of script launch on Python 3.5:

```python

>>> from quadratic_equation import get_roots

>>> get_roots(4,6,2)
(-1.0, -0.5)
```

# Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)
